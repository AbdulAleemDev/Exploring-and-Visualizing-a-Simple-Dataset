# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The objective of this task is to **load, inspect, and visualize** a dataset to understand its structure, trends, and value distributions.  
This involves:
- Checking dataset dimensions and column names.
- Exploring summary statistics.
- Creating visualizations to identify relationships, patterns, and outliers.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Iris dataset (available via Seaborn or CSV download).
- **Features**:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Species
- **Type**: Tabular dataset containing measurements of iris flowers.

---

## ðŸ¤– Models Applied
- **No predictive model applied** in this task.  
  The focus is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using:
  - `pandas` for data inspection.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results & Findings
- The dataset consists of 150 samples across 3 iris species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.
- Scatter plots revealed clear separation between *setosa* and other species based on petal measurements.
- Histograms showed distinct value ranges for each feature per species.
- Box plots helped identify potential outliers in sepal width measurements.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Extend visualizations to include pair plots for multi-feature comparison.
- Perform statistical tests to confirm differences between species.
- Apply clustering or classification models for predictive analysis.
